two type of selector
1 child if it is in same position then css implies
2 decendent selectorit should be inside it only
3 universal selector
   /* child slector */
        div>p{
            background-color: brown ;
        color:    red   }
        /* Decendent selector */
        div p {
            font-size: xx-large;
        }
        /*Universal Selector*/
      *{
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }
everything is box in CSS
margin -> Border ->Padding ->content
 .box1{
            color: yellow;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 10px;
            border: 2px solid salmon;
            height: 200px;
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        height include padding bordeer

  div p {
            color: blue;

        div p:first-of-type {
            color: red;

it's 2nd part justapply on first para on div 
specifility 
inline style -> Id selector -> class or Attribute selector or pseudo   -> element selector -> universal selector 
but if you write imporatnt in property then that will imply over inline css
Specificity Calculation
To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:

Universal Selector: 0
Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
ID selectors: 100
Inline styles: 1000
        .yellow{
            color: yellow;
        }
        .cpurple
        {
            color:purple;
        }
        .cred{
            color: red;
        }
        h1{

        [data-x="a"]{

Differences between Outlines and Borders:
While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot.
    /* overflow: scroll; */

            overflow: auto;
